# Tracing with Arize

In this lab, you'll use Arize to add tracing to your RAG application. [Follow the Quickstart Guide here.](https://arize.com/docs/ax/observe/quickstart-llm). You'll need to create a free account to get an API key. If you run into issues, check out their [demo notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Arize-ai/tutorials/blob/main/python/llm/tracing/openai/openai-tracing.ipynb). (_Note: Google Colab is just an online version of Jupyter Notebooks. You can run it directly in your browser._)

> ðŸ’¡ Reminder: Whenever you see `pip install`, use `poetry add` instead to keep your dependencies up to date.

> ðŸ’¡ It can be tricky to find the dashboard from the docs. To access it, go to `arize.com` instead of staying on `arize.com/docs`.

Once you have tracing working, run your app a few times and explore the logs in Arize. While there are many tracing tools, most look and behave similarly, so what youâ€™re seeing here will be familiar on other platforms. Then, try breaking your app and running it again to see what an error looks like in the logs.
